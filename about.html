				<h4>About</h4>
	      <p>Our motivation was to solve a real world visual problem. We were interested in the health domain, because this is an area receiving heavy media attention for its need to receive design work. One area needing immediate work is health care services costs, and the transparency of the issues involved with that information. Costs are currently increasing, and patients are expressing difficulties accessing the cost for a particular health service prior to their visit. Thus, we are designing a visualization tool with a goal to allow prospective patients to inquire average health care costs, and for specific services. Our target audience is approximately ages 18-100+.</p>
	        </br>
	      <p>Using government provided data (data.gov), we have extrapolated useful information regarding health care services costs and average costs for specific services. Secondly, we allow the user to acquire details on demand by state or by service category. Third, the user can filter data to specific search queries, (i.e. As a patient in Texas needing cancer treatment, I want to know the average costs for my cancer healthcare service in my state).</p>
	        </br>
	      <p> <ul>Major current day (2015) healthcare concerns we explore in some fashion with our design:
		        	<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/leahbinder/2013/02/21/the-five-biggest-problems-in-health-care-today/">1. Lack of transparency </a></li>
		        	<li><a href="http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/the-8-biggest-healthcare-issues-in-2015-so-far.html">2. Health care costs for the average family are increasing</a></li>
		        </ul>
				</p>
				</br>
		  <p>
		  You may also notice that some of the datapoints within a drg have things like W/ MCC or W/O MCC or CC. This is what's called major complications and co-morbidities. Major complications essentially means that the patient had something negative and out of the norm happen during the medical procedure. Co-morbidities means that the patient had multiple things going on besides the single service that the drg mentioned.
