      <p>Our motivation was to solve a real world visual problem. We were interested in the health domain, because this is an area receiving heavy media attention for its need to receive design work. One area needing immediate work is health care services costs, and the transparency of the issues involved with that information. Costs are currently increasing, and patients are expressing difficulties accessing the cost for a particular health service prior to their visit.â€‹ Thus we are designing a visualization tool with a goal to allow prospective patients to inquire average health care costs, and for specific services. Our target audience is approximately ages 18-100+.</p>
        </br>
      <p>Using government provided data, we have extrapolated useful information regarding health care services costs and display an initial overview of the averages for all services across all states initially. Secondly, allow the user to acquire details on demand by state or by service category. Third, the user filters data to specific search queries, (i.e. As a patient in Texas needing cancer treatment, I want to know the average costs for my cancer healthcare service in my state).</p>
        </br>
      <p>Major current day (2015) healthcare concerns we explore in some fashion with our design:
        1. Lack of transparency (http://www.forbes.com/sites/leahbinder/2013/02/21/the-five-biggest-problems-in-health-care-today/)
        2. Health care costs for the average family are increasing (http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/the-8-biggest-healthcare-issues-in-2015-so-far.html)</p>
